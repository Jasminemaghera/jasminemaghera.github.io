Hey there! Check out my 100% recycled Omnipod covers! Each cover is hand formed and painted with love. I use all sorts of materials such as resin, acrylic, nail varnish, contact paper, gold flake and iridescent rhinestones! If you would like a custom send me a message and we can figure out how to make it happen!
