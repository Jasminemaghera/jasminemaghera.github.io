    {% include item-canvas.html title="Snakes and Letters" description="Acrylic paint on canvas (20” X 15”). Black snakes, beautiful vines and yellow paint. This snake is perfect for that urban jungle vibe. The curves add a nice movement to the corners of rooms and walls." image="canvases/snakes.jpeg" price="160" %}

    {% include item-canvas.html title="Grab Nature by the Leaves" description="Embroidery on acrylic canvas background (11” X 14”). So by now you all likely know that I LOVE plants and leaves. This painting (embroidery?) is inspired by my plants. This work embodies the feeling of running your hands through your plants to find the most supple looking branch and appreciating the hard work that went into keeping it alive. The feeling of the soft leaves folding under your touch as the branch stands tall is also one I tried to convey through this art."  image="canvases/nature.jpeg" price="80" %}

    {% include item-canvas.html title="Insulin is Life (Insulin Pen with Daisies)" description="Acrylic paint with gold accents with resin coat (8” x 8”). This painting was done to celebrate the 100th year anniversary of the discovery of insulin! This piece was inspired by the millions of people living with type 1 and type 2 diabetes who continue to smile and work through the highs and lows of diabetes. Unfortunately, living with diabetes isn’t always a walk in the park (or a field of daisies) but those who live with it do it well and I praise your strength and dedication."  image="canvases/daisy.jpeg" price="70" %}

    {% include item-canvas.html title="Insulin is Life (Insulin Pen with Pink Roses)" description="Acrylic paint with gold accents with resin coat (8” x 8”). This painting was done to celebrate the 100th year anniversary of the discovery of insulin! This piece was inspired by the millions of people living with type 1 and type 2 diabetes who continue to smile and work through the highs and lows of diabetes. Did you that many people with type 1 diabetes on multiple daily injections take up to 7-10 injections a day, that’s a lot of math and decision making to keep their blood sugars in check! Good job everyone!"  image="canvases/roses.jpeg" price="70" %}

    {% include item-canvas.html title="Insulin is Life (Insulin Vial + Syringe with String of Hearts)" description="Acrylic paint with gold accents with resin coat (8 x 8”). This painting was done to celebrate the 100th year anniversary of the discovery of insulin! This piece was inspired by the millions of people living with type 1 and type 2 diabetes who continue to smile and work through the highs and lows of diabetes. Although insulin sustains life for many people, it is not a cure, and the growth needed to manage a tough disease is astronomical. From carb counting to insulin dosing to staying in between two lines 24 hours a day — it is a full time job. If you are supporting a loved one living with diabetes or you are someone living with diabetes, celebrate yourself including your highs and lows."  image="canvases/string.jpeg" price="65" %}

    {% include item-canvas.html title="Monsters and Monsteras" description="Acrylic paint with embroidered monstera leaves (20” X 15”). This painting conveys energy and optimism with a bauhaus feel with a modern twist. <b>This Painting Has Been Sold</b> "  image="canvases/monstera.jpeg" price="200" %}
